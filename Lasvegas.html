    <p>For Memorial weekend; a national holiday in North America, I visited Sin city with friends. I got to experience an oasis of glittering lights in the desert, the home of the Strip and the drive-in wedding chapel, the playground of the Mob, and a visual spectacle complete with its own Eiffel Tower, Egyptian pyramids, and Venetian canals.</p>

    <p>It's a place that's defined as much by vintage camp as by futuristic innovation, where the classic steakhouses and 24-hour casinos exist alongside world-class dining, sleek hotels, and thrilling entertainment. It was impossible to ever be bored.</p>

    <li><p><a href="https://daylightvegas.com/">Fountains of Bellagio:</a> Water that dances like ballerinas. Cannons that shoot water hundreds of feet in the air. Yes, the fountains that span the artificial lake in front of Bellagio Las Vegas have become one of the most iconic Vegas sights. It comprises of more than 1,000 fountains in all, some shooting spray more than 450 feet into the air.

    <h2 class="pageSubTitle"> Day Parties</h2>

  <section>
    <p>Las Vegas is full of day parties and clubs. They are a lot like a nightclub, but with more water, less clothing and better hours. With celebrity performances and international headlining DJs, you do not want to miss out on these pool parties.</p>
