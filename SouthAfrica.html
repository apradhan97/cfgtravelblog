    <ol>

    <li><p><b>Robberg Nature Reserve, Plettenberg Bay:</b>Robberg Nature Reserve, situated 8km south of Plettenberg Bay on the Garden Route, is not only a nature reserve, but also a national monument. Rocks from this region date back 120 million years to the break-up of Gondwanaland and evidence of middle and later Stone Age inhabitation has been found in a few of the caves along the peninsula.</li></p>

    <li><p><b>Storms River Suspension Bridge:</b>The suspension bridge that hangs over the red-brown waters of the Storms River Mouth spans 77 metres and remains one of the most popular tourist attractions of the Tsitsikamma region of the Eastern Cape. Situated within the Tsitsikamma National Park, it was originally built in 1969, but has since been rebuilt by San-Parks to ensure its stability and safety. 
                        It hangs just seven metres above the churning waters of the river as it enters the foamy Indian Ocean.</li></p>

    <li><p><b>Knysna Heads & Knysna Forest</b>The Knysna Heads are a pair of sandstone cliffs that separate the Knysna Lagoon from the sea beyond; a famous landmark along the renowned Garden Route. The eastern head is easily accessible by car and has many spectacular viewpoints overlooking the channel, Indian Ocean, 
                        the Knysna Lagoon and estuary, and the Outeniqua Mountains. In fact, it was because of its excellent lookout that the
                        National Sea Rescue Institute (Station 12, Knysna) chose to build its observation room here.

                        There is also easy access to rock pools and beaches from the eastern head. The western head is accessible 
                        only by ferry, and forms part of the privately owned Featherbed Nature Reserve. There are 4-hour excursions 
                        to the reserve departing from the Knysna Waterfront daily.</li></p>
