    <p>Just before the world went into lockdown, I was lucky enough to revisit the beautiful city of Berlin. Even on my second trip, I wasn't able to fully experience the depth of this city's history and culture - there is just too much to see! To make it somewhat easier, I've picked 3 must-see places in the city that I hope you will enjoy too...</p>

    <li><p>Berlin's transport system (e.g. buses, trains and trams) travel a mega distance each day which is the equivalent of going around the earth 8.7 times.</p></li>

    <li><p>70 million currywurst are eaten each <u>YEAR</u> in Berlin. I won't deny that it tastes delicious, but it does seems a tad excessive.</p></li>

    <li><p>There are over 180km of navigable waterways in Berlin - take a boat tour to get a new perspective of the city!</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum fur Film und Fernsehen:</b> Berlin's Filmmuseum is one of the most unique and interesting museums I have ever been to. I was in absolute awe of the design of their exhibitions which really helped you immerse yourself in the history of German cinema. The place is filled to the brim with incredible artefacts particularly their collection of memorabilia that once belonged to the iconic German actress Marlene Dietrich.</li></p>

            <figcaption><i>Marlene Dietrich collection at the museum</i></figcaption>

    <li><p><b>DDR Museum:</b> If film history isn't your thing, perhaps you'll find the DDR Museum more interesting albeit a tad strange. At the DDR museum you can safely experience life under communism and the reality of living in East Berlin. Again, this is an unreal museum experience and unlike anything I have seen in London.</li></p>

        </div>
    
<li><p><b>East Side Gallery:</b> The East Side Gallery was my main highlight when I first visited Berlin. It is an incredible display of Berlin's social and cultural history - the range of artwork that covers those walls and the messages they present is stunning. The entire gallery spans over 1.3km so definitely worth taking some time out to really appreciate all that it offers.</li></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.moviemento.de/">Moviemento Kino</a> is a small independent cinema, one of the oldest in Berlin, tucked away in the Kreuzberg district. I was staying in a hostel near the cinema and stumbled across it during a walk. Inside, the cinema is super cosy with the nicest staff, a great selection of drinks & snacks and equally great programme of films. If you don't want to watch a film they have two bars at the back of the cinema which are really cool to just relax in and grab a few beers with friends. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area!</p>
